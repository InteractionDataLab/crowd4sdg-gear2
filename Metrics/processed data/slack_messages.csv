Dear All,

We hope you are all doing well. The delay in submission of the surveys, caused a delay in the team formation. We tried our best to retain those who have applied as teams and have grouped the rest, based on their expressed interest, skills and personality traits. *Please find an overview of all teams<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IvKROgeuVjLz0fXrZpGORlssLcA29qwFTluaJEV73SI/edit#gid=0| here.>* Please reach out to your mates via slack_*.*_ We let you decide as a team on the idea you would like to proceed. Hope you had a chance to review the video shared by <@U02JB5Z745T>, on the four challenges. 

To be prepared for our next session, please be aware of the following points.

The problem can be improved by providing a means to collect data on how much effect flood has on men and women. And comparing to know how women are impacted differently in relation to men

Our method is to develop a mobile application with the following features:

Space for educating and empowering users on flooding and risk factors that can cause flooding.

Flood risk Map indicating areas that are prone to flooding to alert communities and also allow citizens to add flood locations as well as images for better understanding of flood causes, who it impacts and to help get faster relief funds.

The App will also accept youths volunteer to collect data from their communities through the in-app survey and including  engaging women on focused group discussions on their different community’s adaptation and coping strategies during flood in the app to help them interact and support each other in different areas to prepare for flood disaster and preventive measures.

Collecting Reports of flood out breaks by citizens with images and locations to add to the map.

Lack of communication, integration and coordination among government agencies and the communities.

    Government agencies such as NEMA has a department for planning and utilizing geographical  information system (GIS) to work on flood data,but their is still no effective national early warning system in place for floods at all levels of such as state,local,federal, national.

     NIMET, national meteorological Agency also provides seasonal rainfall predictions,but communication remains a problem.


Corruption is another cause for the lack of flood data. Large amounts of funds are released for flood activities but yet people still struggle with flood and no equipment has been seen set in place for collecting data and flood readings.


Historically, Nigeria has been more focused on post disaster flood response than control. This all stems down to lack of data on flood.


Their is also an absence of flood risk maps which is an indicator for the lack of attention paid to Nigeria's flooding problem.


   Flooding threatens sustainability because it negativity affects the economy,social life, environment and health.


   With an accurate and available flood data,the root causes of flood can be tackled, people can be helped more efficiently based on gender and impact.","flood-rangers","A4: Flood Rangers"

"759","U02K45TM5GQ",2021-11-02 18:40:56,"Ciao a tutti, allora mi sono venute un pajo di idee per sviluppare l'app. La prima idea è quella di orientare la nostra app verso più un approccio modello social network. Laddove gli utenti singoli o le associazioni interagiscono per risolvere i problemi. Del tipo, io persona sono in mezzo a questo disastro ambientale, mi iscrivo all'applicazione, l'applicazione mi mette in contatto con gente (precedentemente iscritta all'applicazione), che mi aiuta a risolverlo, che mi da consigli. Cioè in pratica apre una chat.
Una volta risolto il problema, tu compili un questionario dove spieghi come, perché, che conseguenze hai avuto, dove hai avuto questo problema e come l'hai risolto in modo tale che un altro utente, qualora dovesse avere lo stesso problema si iscrive e si mette in  contatto con te che l'hai già risolto.
Lo stesso processo potremmo farlo valere per le associazioni che si occupano di problemi ambientali e nel questionario, una volta risolto il problema, esse potrebbero indicare quanto ha inficiato il ruolo delle donne, che ruoli occupano nell'azienda. Insomma queste cose qui. Inoltre, per favorire che le donne inizino ad occupare ruoli di maggiore rilevanza in un'associazione, potremmo favorire nell'app le aziende con più donne. Dando loro consigli migliori.","team-water-warriors","B1: Water Warriors"

"771","U02K45TM5GQ",2021-11-02 18:51:07,"Questa è un'idea che non c'entra col nostro progetto perché si distanzia abbastanza dalla nostra idea però mi sembra giusto dirla per ""giocare a carte scoperte"", qualche settimana fa ho visto un video che parlava del problema dell'acqua in Africa e di come abbiano inventato un mezzo economico e poco costoso per risolverlo.
Il metodo consiste nel fabbricare dei filtri per pulire l'acqua in plastica e facili da fare e mi piacerebbe fare qualcosa in questo senso. Magari associazioni che raccolgono la plastica in occidente (visto che qui è un problema, lo spreco di plastica) e la usano per fare questi filtri che in Africa possono aiutare a risolvere il problema dell'acqua.

• Slide #11: Your video is an app which needs an internet connection for the weather predictions at least. Be sure to make it *clear* that, your solution is available for those who have mobile app, and also it will send direct voice messages to the ones who don't have a smart phone or internet (as you say on slide #6). Do not expect the jury remember that info.
• General: There are several syntax errors (typos) in English. You can use an online tool to fix them (e.g. <http://grammarly.com|grammarly.com>).
• Try to rehearse well before your pitch so that all the information you want to give is transmitted in time (5 mins).
I believe you have set clear goals. The jury will see that. Then, the important thing will be to convince them that you could realize these in reasonable time and effort that you propose.
Good luck!","team-women-for-sustainable-world","Tool Owner"

"843","U02KFCYC49F",2021-11-12 11:55:57,"I have just seen your slides and here are my comments as food for thought:
*Slide #1*
I understand the need for two lines in the app, but is it too ambitious to follow both of them for this pitch? Can the voice assistant be a future step regarding feasibility?
*#4*
I would like to see more details of the AI app needed as it is the backbone of the project. Specifically, how do you intend to collect and interpret the meteorological data using AI?
*#5*
Is there a backing study/report for the mentioned production? I recommend you to always back up your claims with published studies. This could go as a last slide ""References"" and you refer to each related source on the slide you use it.
*#6*
Is the Timetable realistic? One month of programming? How many programmers and with which skills would you need? Also, you assign the same day for the test, bug fixes and the release of the app.","team-women-for-sustainable-world","Tool Owner"
"844","U02KFCYC49F",2021-11-12 12:02:18,"I believe you have a keen vision to address very important problems of your region. Congrats for that!:clap:
However, beside good ideas, feasibility is always important.
• Stay focused, try to solve the problems one by one, if you can.
• Support your claims (e.g. expected increase in production) with articles/reports accessible by everyone.
• Give enough details about your app and the timetable to make your pitch credible.
• Try not to leave gaps that can make the jury doubt whether the project is feasible.
• Finally, as advices for presentation:
    ◦ Try not to swamp the slides with too much text. 
    ◦ Use visuals as much as you can. 
    ◦ Emphasize the figures (e.g. 95%, 80%) you give. 
    ◦ Leave some of the text to your speech.","team-women-for-sustainable-world","Tool Owner"

"855","U02KFRM6A2U",2021-11-03 09:48:13,"Si, io cercherei di evidenziare il contributo femminile nell'applicazione. L'applicazione offrirà una bacheca dove sarà possibile consultare le varie voci e quindi già questo potrebbe essere usato in ottica di social media. Una chat come idea è interessante, ma dovremmo gestirla bene in modo da non creare confusione. Secondo me più che una chat sarebbe meglio creare dei gruppi dedicati, ovvero quando c'è un disastro o un evento ambientale, gli utenti vengono messi in contatto attraverso un link (ogni utente precedentemente registrato riceve un link per iscriversi a un gruppo, come a un gruppo telegram comune). Così le persone coinvolte nello stesso evento si mettono in contatto attraverso il gruppo","team-water-warriors","B1: Water Warriors"
"856","U02KFRM6A2U",2021-11-03 09:52:19,"Il questionario di report per un evento viene già gestito dall'applicazione. Potremmo fare che una persona registrata, trovando un evento analogo, si mette in contatto con gli utenti che hanno generato quei report. Inoltre l'utente nuovo può vedere delle statistiche su eventi analoghi. A questo proposito, dovremmo definire un concetto di *similarità tra eventi*, per fare in modo che un nuovo utente registrato possa avere subito evidenti gli eventi che sono più simili possibili a quello che a lui interessa. Potremmo creare un concetto di similarità tra eventi basata sulla posizione, per esempio per distinguere contesti urbani da quelli rurali, zone climatiche differenti (es. tropicali, temperate, ecc.), ""portata dell'evento"" intesa come dimensioni e entità.","team-water-warriors","B1: Water Warriors"
"858","U02KFRM6A2U",2021-11-03 10:01:34,"Sicuramente dobbiamo trovare un'applicazione simile per fare l'estensione. Potremmo considerare l'estensione come sotto categoria della nostra applicazione, cioè fare in modo che ci siano dei link nell'applicazione più forte già esistente per rimandare alla nostra. Oppure inserire delle voci di report (esempio, mettere solo la funzione di report nell'applicazione più forte e registrare i dati direttamente sulla nostra).","team-water-warriors","B1: Water Warriors"
"859","U02KFRM6A2U",2021-11-03 10:06:33,"Si, esatto. Più che altro è un buon metodo per creare una sorta di vademecum, dove le persone possano confrontarsi. In questo caso, secondo me è necessario definire una metrica di similarità per fare in modo che le persone possano vedere qualcosa di simile a quello di cui hanno bisogno. Inoltre, siccome uno storico è appetibile se ci sono dati, potremmo fare in modo di estrapolare prima i dati dalla rete (es. vedere come sono state risolte emergenze precedenti, e fare già una classifica o uno storico generico). Possiamo quindi inizializzare l'app con i resoconti già esistenti introducendo anche i dati raccolti dall'applicazione più potente della nostra. In questo modo avremmo già una sorta di inizializzazione dei dati, e questo è utile perché per gli utenti partire da zero è più difficile.","team-water-warriors","B1: Water Warriors"
